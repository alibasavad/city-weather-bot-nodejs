# Welcom to CityWeatherBot

This is a simple telegram bot to get weather information from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/).

Currently, this robot returns information about the current weather condition of a city just by taking the name of the city

In the future, I plan to implement more features to this bot such as:
- Better appearance
- More information of weather data
- More userfreindly environment

I hope you enjoy using CityWeatherBot! Let me know if you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements.
